![Black Screen of Life](./readme-img/title.png)

Simple Android app that allows you to turn off the screen, while keeping background apps running. This allows for a huge battery save, as the screen consumes the most battery in a smartphone.

Useful for listening to YouTube videos with the screen turned off, or any other scenario where you are not looking at the phone.

It features my famous derpy design, one of the most remarkable trademarks of this application (:

I'm publishing the source code of BSoL, making it effectively free, since I'm phasing out my website where you could previously purchase BSoL. Feel free to use/copy/improve the source code, and let me know if you do it!

The code is certainly out of date, as I developed this back in 2016 and never really took the time to properly update it. So I'm not expecting it to work on newer phones / newer versions of Android Studio.

If you just want to use BSoL, the easiest way is to download and install the APK file from the [releases section](https://github.com/derpdeveloperofficial/Black-Screen-of-Life/releases).

It has been a pleasure.

Cheers,

Derp Developer
